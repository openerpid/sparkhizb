# Sparkhizb â€“ A full-featured library creation and transfer class for PHP

## Installation & loading

```sh
composer require sparkhizb/lib dev-main
```
```sh
ln -s vendor/sparkhizb/lib/src/Commands/HizbInstallCommand.php app/Commands/HizbInstallCommand.php
```
```sh
php spark hizb:install
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of Sparkhizb.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

## A Simple Example

```php
<?php
//Import Sparkhizb classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use Sparkhizb\Auth;
use Sparkhizb\Helpers\BuilderHelper;
use Sparkhizb\Helpers\QueryHelper;

//Load Composer's autoloader (created by composer, not included with Sparkhizb)
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```
